## The CIA Triad

The CIA triad is an information security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a security policy. This model has an extensive background, ranging from being used in 1998.
This history is because the security of information (information security) does not start and/or end with cybersecurity, but instead, applies to scenarios like filing, record storage, etc.
Consisting of three sections: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA), this model has quickly become an industry standard today. This model should help determine the value of data that 
it applies to, and in turn, the attention it needs from the business.

The CIA triad is unlike a traditional model where you have individual sections; instead, it is a continuous cycle. Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad can arguably overlap, if even just one 
element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless (similar to the fire triangle). If a security policy does not answer these three sections, it is seldom an effective security policy.

Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad are arguably self-explanatory, let's explore these and contextualise them into cybersecurity.

### Confidentiality

This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse. Organisations will always have some form of sensitive data stored on their systems. To provide confidentiality is to
protect this data from parties that it is not intended for.

There are many real-world examples for this, for example, employee records and accounting documents will be considered sensitive. Confidentiality will be provided in the sense that only 
HR administrators will access employee records, where vetting and tight access controls are in place. Accounting records are less valuable (and therefore less sensitive), so not as 
stringent access controls would be in place for these documents. Or, for example, governments using a sensitivity classification rating system (top-secret, classified, unclassified)

### Integrity

The CIA triad element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made. 
It is possible for the information to change because of careless access and use, errors in the information system, or unauthorized access and use. In the CIA triad, integrity is maintained 
when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and usage not involving modification to the information. Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by 
unauthorised people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality).

Many defences to ensure integrity can be put in place. Access control and rigorous authentication can help prevent authorized users from making unauthorized changes. 
Hash verifications and digital signatures can help ensure that transactions are authentic and that files have not been modified or corrupted.

### Availability

In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.

The main concern in the CIA triad is that the information should be available when authorised users need to access it.

Availability is very often a key benchmark for an organisation. For example, having 99.99% uptime on their websites or systems (this is laid out in Service Level Agreements). 
When a system is unavailable, it often results in damage to an organisations reputation and loss of finances. Availability is achieved through a combination of many elements, including:
      1. Having reliable and well-tested hardware for their information technology servers (i.e. reputable servers)
      2. Having redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
      3. Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack

## Principles of Privileges

It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an information technology system individuals require. 

The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
    1. The individual's role/function within the organisation
    2. The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system


Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals, two key concepts are used: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (or PAM for short).

Initially, these two concepts can seem to overlap; however, they are different from one another. PIM is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system. 
Whereas PAM is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.

What is essential when discussing privilege and access controls is the principle of least privilege. Simply, users should be given the minimum amount of privileges, and only those that are absolutely necessary 
for them to perform their duties. Other people should be able to trust what people write to.

As we previously mentioned, PAM incorporates more than assigning access. It also encompasses enforcing security policies such as password management, auditing policies and reducing the attack surface a system faces.

## Security Models Continued

Before discussing security models further, let's recall the three elements of the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. We've previously outlined what these elements 
are and their importance. However, there is a formal way of achieving this.

According to a security model, any system or piece of technology storing information is called an information system, which is how we will reference systems and devices in this task.

Let's explore some popular and effective security models used to achieve the three elements of the CIA triad.

### The Bell-La Padula Model

The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve confidentiality. This model has a few assumptions, such as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's 
responsibilities/roles are well-defined.

The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".

------------------------------------------------
                    Advantages 
------------------------------------------------

Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisations hierarchies(and vice versa)

Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.

-----------------------------------------------
                  Disadvantages
-----------------------------------------------

Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence so it's not confidential in that aspect.

The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation.

-------------------------------------------------

The Bell LaPadula Model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military. This is because members of the organisations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting. 
Vetting is a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to the organisation. 
Therefore, applicants who are successfully vetted are assumed to be trustworthy - which is where this model fits in.
