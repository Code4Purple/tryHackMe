## System Configuration

The System Configuration utility (MSConfig) is for advanced troubleshooting, and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. 
Reference the following document here() for more information on the System Configuration utility. 
As you can see, Microsoft advises using Task Manager (taskmgr) to manage (enable/disable) startup items. The System Configuration utility is NOT a startup management program. 
Note: If you open Task Manager for the attached VM, you will notice that Task Manager doesn't show a Startup tab.
